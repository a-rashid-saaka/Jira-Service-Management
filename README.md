<p>The diagram outlines the stages of a service ticket. It starts with Ticket Creation, where a user reports an issue. Next is classification, which sorts the ticket by type and priority. Assignment and Escalation assign it to the right team and escalate if needed. Resolution Steps involve fixing the issue while keeping the user informed. Finally, Resolution and Closure mark the problem as solved and close the ticket, ensuring an organized approach to handling user issues..</p>


<h3>&#9312; Ticket Creation</h3>


<p>Ticket creation in Jira is the process of logging and defining an issue that needs to be resolved. This can involve tasks, incidents, service requests, or bugs, depending on the type of project. In Jira Service Management, ticket creation is often initiated by end users, agents, or the system.</p>

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to creating a ticket in Jira:

<h4>IV. Customize Fields (if needed)</h4>
   
- Add custom fields such as:
   - Components: Specify parts of the system affected (e.g., "Database").
   - Labels: Use tags for categorization (e.g., "Critical").

     
<h4>V. Attach Files (Optional)</h4>

<h3>&#9313; Classification </h3>

<p>Ticket classification in Jira is the process of categorizing tickets based on specific criteria, such as issue type, priority, status, or components. This helps organize work, streamline workflows, and ensure efficient resolution by assigning tickets to the right teams or individuals.

<h4>Key Categories for Ticket Classification</h4>

- Priority:
  
  - Indicates the urgency of the ticket.
  - Common levels: Critical, High, Medium, Low.

- Status:
