<p>The diagram outlines the stages of a service ticket. It starts with Ticket Creation, where a user reports an issue. Next is classification, which sorts the ticket by type and priority. Assignment and Escalation assign it to the right team and escalate if needed. Resolution Steps involve fixing the issue while keeping the user informed. Finally, Resolution and Closure mark the problem as solved and close the ticket, ensuring an organized approach to handling user issues..</p>


<h3>&#9312; Ticket Creation</h3>


<p>Ticket creation in Jira is the process of logging and defining an issue that needs to be resolved. This can involve tasks, incidents, service requests, or bugs, depending on the type of project. In Jira Service Management, ticket creation is often initiated by end users, agents, or the system.</p>

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to creating a ticket in Jira:

<h4>I. Access the Jira Project</h4>

- Log in to Jira using your credentials.
- Navigate to the specific project where you want to create the ticket (e.g., IT Support).

<h4>II. Click on "Create"</h4>

 Click the Create button on the Jira dashboard (typically at the top right of the page).
  
<h4>III. Fill in Ticket Details</h4>

Fill in the form with details such as project, issue type, request type, summary, description, and any other required details
  

<h4>IV. Customize Fields (if needed)</h4>
   
- Add custom fields such as:
   - Components: Specify system parts affected (e.g., "Database").
   - Labels: Use tags for categorization (e.g., "Critical").

     
<h4>V. Attach Files (Optional)</h4>
Use the Attach Files option to upload relevant screenshots, logs, or documents.

<h4>VI. Submit the Ticket</h4>
Click the Create button to log the ticket into the project.

<br>
<br>
Select the "Queue" to view the tickets available

<h3>&#9313; Classification </h3>

<p>Ticket classification in Jira is the process of categorizing tickets based on specific criteria, such as issue type, priority, status, or components. This helps organize work, streamline workflows, and ensure efficient resolution by assigning tickets to the right teams or individuals. 
  
Here's a detailed look at the key aspects of ticket classification:</p>


<h4>I. Key Categories for Ticket Classification</h4>

- Issue Types:
   - Incident: For unplanned disruptions or system failures.
   - Task: For general work items or operational tasks.
   - Service Request: For user requests, such as account access or installations.

- Priority:
  
  - Indicates the urgency of the ticket.
  - Common levels: Critical, High, Medium, Low.

- Status:
  
  - Tracks the lifecycle of a ticket.
  - Example statuses: Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed.

- Components:
  
  - Refers to specific subsystems or areas affected by the ticket.
  - Example: Backend, Database, UI.

- Labels:
  
  - Custom tags for additional categorization.
  - Example: "Critical Issue," "Customer Request."
    
<br>

<h4>II. How to Set Up Ticket Classification in Jira</h4>

- Customize Issue Types:
  - Navigate to Project Settings > Issue Types.
  - Add or modify issue types to fit the team's needs.

- Define Priorities:
  - Go to Jira Settings > Issues > Priorities.
  - Configure priority levels and associate them with workflows.

- Use Components:
  - Navigate to Project Settings > Components.
  - Define components for the project (e.g., "API," "Frontend").
    
- Set Labels:

You can encourage the use of labels during ticket creation for easy filtering.

<h3>&#9314; Ticket Assignment and Escalation </h3>
Ticket Assignment and Escalation in Jira are core processes used to ensure that issues are addressed by the appropriate team or individual within a defined timeframe. These processes are critical for maintaining workflow efficiency, meeting service-level agreements (SLAs), and resolving issues effectively.

<h4>Methods of Assignment:</h4>

<h4>I. Manual Assignment:</h4>

- Agents or team leads assign tickets based on expertise or workload.
- Process:
  - Open the ticket.
  - Select the Assignee field.
  - Choose a team member from the dropdown.

<h4>II. Automatic Assignment:</h4>

- Round-Robin: Distribute tickets evenly across team members.
- Based on Criteria:
  - Use Automation Rules in Jira to assign tickets.
     - Go to Project Settings > Automation.
     - Create a rule:

   <p><strong>The example above automates assigning Active Directory issues to system-administrators</strong></p>
<br>
<h4>When to Escalate:</h4>
<strong>I. SLA Breach:</strong>
When a ticket is close to violating SLA timelines.

<strong>II.Complexity:</strong>
If the issue is beyond the expertise of the current assignee.

<strong>III. High Priority:</strong> Tickets requiring immediate attention due to business impact.

<strong>IV. Approval:</strong> Some tickets may require managerial or senior-level approval.

<h4>How Escalation Works:</h4>

<strong>Manually:</strong>

- Agents manually reassign the ticket to another team or tier.
- Example: Reassigning a "High Priority Bug" from Tier 1 to Tier 2 support.

<strong>Automatically (Using Automation Rules):</strong>

Trigger: SLA about to breach or a specific condition is met.
Action: Reassign the ticket to a senior team or notify stakeholders.
Example: Create a rule: "If priority = High and SLA time remaining < 1 hour, escalate to Tier 2."
